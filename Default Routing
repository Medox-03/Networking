# Default Routing Configuration Lab

This lab demonstrates the setup and verification of **default routing** between two or more networks using Cisco routers and switches. The goal is to ensure communication across networks using a **default route** configuration.

---

## Lab Topology

[PC0] --- [Switch0] --- [Router0] --- [Router1] --- [Switch1] --- [PC1]



- **Router0** connected to **Router1**
- **Switches** connected to PCs and routers
- **End Devices** (PC0 and PC1) to test network connectivity

---

## Devices Used

- 2 Routers (e.g., 2911)
- 2 Switches (e.g., 2960)
- 2 PCs

## IP Addressing Scheme

| Device   | Interface        | IP Address      | Subnet Mask       |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| PC0      | NIC               | 192.168.1.10    | 255.255.255.0     |
| Switch0  | N/A               | (default VLAN1) |                   |
| Router0  | Gig0/0            | 192.168.1.1     | 255.255.255.0     |
| Router0  | Gig0/1            | 10.0.0.1        | 255.255.255.252   |
| Router1  | Gig0/0            | 10.0.0.2        | 255.255.255.252   |
| Router1  | Gig0/1            | 192.168.2.1     | 255.255.255.0     |
| Switch1  | N/A               | (default VLAN1) |                   |
| PC1      | NIC               | 192.168.2.10    | 255.255.255.0     |

## Step-by-Step Configuration

### 1. Configure PC IP Addresses

- On **PC0**:
  - IP address: `192.168.1.10`
  - Subnet mask: `255.255.255.0`
  - Default gateway: `192.168.1.1`
- On **PC1**:
  - IP address: `192.168.2.10`
  - Subnet mask: `255.255.255.0`
  - Default gateway: `192.168.2.1`

---

### 2. Configure Router0

enable configure terminal

hostname Router0

interface GigabitEthernet0/0 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0 no shutdown

interface GigabitEthernet0/1 ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.252 no shutdown

ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.0.0.2

end write memory

---

### 3. Configure Router1

enable configure terminal

hostname Router1

interface GigabitEthernet0/0 ip address 10.0.0.2 255.255.255.252 no shutdown

interface GigabitEthernet0/1 ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0 no shutdown

ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.0.0.1

end write memory

---

### 4. Verify Connectivity

On both routers, use:

show ip route

show ip interface brief

to verify interfaces are up and routes are correct.

From **PC0**, ping **PC1**:

ping 192.168.2.10

From **PC1**, ping **PC0**:

ping 192.168.1.10

---

## Expected Result

- All pings should succeed.
- The routing table on each router should show a **default route** (`S* 0.0.0.0/0`).

---

## Conclusion

This lab illustrates the configuration of **default routes** between two networks across routers, enabling full end-to-end communication even without manually configuring all routes.

âœ… **Lab Completed Successfully**
